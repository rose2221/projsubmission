I utilized the EmailJS service to automate the email generation and sending process when a user clicks the submit button. The intention was to send the email to TEDx IIT Roorkee's official email address. However, I couldn't proceed with the integration because I lacked access to TEDx IIT Roorkee's email address. You can follow the instructions provided on this website, "https://www.emailjs.com/docs/examples/reactjs/," to achieve a similar functionality.
